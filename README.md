# DSH Superagent on Coolify

> Unofficial integration. This specifically targets Coolify's **Caddy**
> reverse proxy. Traefik labels are different.

## Architecture

```
Browser (HTTPS)
  -> Coolify Caddy proxy :443
    -> dashboard (internal Caddy :8080)
       -> superagent:3083 (socat tunnel to DSH 127.0.0.1:3082)
```

Access is authenticated by DSH itself: the launch-token URL that DSH prints in
the container log mints a signed, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict` session cookie
(valid 30 days, kept across restarts). Without it the DSH UI and its `/api`
answer 401.

The Superagent management API (`/orchestrator/api/*`) performs no
authentication of its own: it only accepts `Host: 127.0.0.1:3082` or
`localhost:3082` and no foreign `Origin`, trusting that only local processes
reach it. The inner proxy rewrites those headers so the browser panel works,
and therefore must authenticate those requests itself. Before forwarding, it
asks DSH whether the request carries a valid session cookie (`forward_auth`
to `GET /`, which DSH answers with 200 or 401), and it rejects cross-site
requests by their `Sec-Fetch-Site` header. Other DSH UI traffic keeps the
public Host, which `--trusted-host` allows.

## 1. Configure Coolify

Create a Git-backed Docker Compose Application referencing `compose.yaml`.
Keep Compose deployment in **normal/managed mode**, not Raw, so Coolify can
connect the dashboard service to its proxy and generate the Caddy route.

In Coolify **Domains**, create an HTTPS domain, e.g. `superagent.example.com`,
assign it to the **`dashboard`** service on **internal port `8080`**.
Do **not** attach the domain to `superagent`.

Configure Environment Variables:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | Model provider secret (runtime only) |
| `GH_TOKEN` | GitHub classic PAT for dedicated agent account (runtime only) |
| `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` | e.g. `ForkbombEu/credimi-attestbook` |
| `SUPERAGENT_DOMAIN` | Public hostname only, e.g. `superagent.example.com` (no https://, no path) |

**Security**: whoever can read the container log can read the launch-token
URL and open the UI. The DSH workers execute code and have repository
credentials. Do not directly publish 3082, 3083 or 8080.

## 2. Deploy, validate and open

Deploy the app from Coolify. When Caddy routes are ready:

```bash
# Both must be HTTP 401 without the DSH session cookie:
curl -I https://superagent.example.com/
curl -i -H 'x-orchestrator-request: 1' https://superagent.example.com/orchestrator/api/state
```

Open the launch URL from the `superagent` service log in Coolify, e.g.

```
dsh web: https://superagent.example.com/?token=...
```

DSH sets the session cookie and redirects to `/`. The token changes on every
restart, but the cookie stays valid, so the log URL is only needed for a new
browser or after 30 days.

## 3. One-time Superagent configuration

Runtime env vars do not configure Superagent's internal GitHub Source, Policy
allowlist, or Executor. In the DSH panel, configure:

- Source GitHub repository and `/usr/local/bin/gh-agent`.
- Eval > GitHub allowed users (your own GitHub account).
- Executor directory `/home/agent/.dsh/state/superagent/work`,
  prepare command `/usr/local/bin/prepare-worktree.sh` and worker concurrency.
- Prompts and a review policy appropriate for your project.

Default proactive accept mode `observe` still accepts explicit requests from
allowlisted users; don't enable automatic inferred work prematurely.

## 4. Operational notes and limitations

- Keep existing service name `superagent` and volume `superagent_home` when
  migrating from the previous package. Docker Compose/Coolify may still
  rename/prefix volume names; **confirm the deployed volume before migration**.
- `superagent:3083` exists on the internal Compose network only. The outer
  Coolify Caddy proxy should route only to `dashboard:8080`.
- DSH itself uses `--public-url` and `--trusted-host` to support the external
  URL. If your pinned DSH CLI version does not recognize those flags, you may
  need to upgrade its version rather than removing the host security check.
- The management API's loopback check is intentionally rewritten by the inner
  proxy, which checks the DSH session cookie instead. A service connected to
  the same internal Docker network can still reach `superagent:3083` directly
  and bypass that check; isolate the deployment from untrusted containers.
- The image build caches npm/pnpm downloads in BuildKit cache mounts on the
  build server. Keep **Advanced > Build cache** on **Use Docker build cache**:
  "Rebuild from scratch" / "Force deploy (without cache)" skip both the layer
  cache and these mounts. Unchanged layers (apt, `dsh` install) are reused
  entirely; the cache mounts speed up the `dsh` install when its layer reruns.
  Because the upstream clone layer is cached too, use a forced rebuild to pick
  up new `dsh-superagent-prototype` commits on `main`.
